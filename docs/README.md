# What is Debt-Collector ?

Debt-Collector is a library and CLI tool written in NodeJs, built to identify, locate, quantify and better manage your project's technical debt.&#x20;

Code bases evolves. Libraries changes and get out of date. Coding standards as well. \
In this ever changing environment, it can be difficult to :&#x20;

* Precisely know what part of your code is out of date, or require attention.
* Mesure the cost of changing something across the entire project.
* If the speed of change/migration is in tune with your objectives
* Remind everybody on your team about the Ã©volution of coding standards

Debt-collector is the missing tool that helps your team manage evolving coding standards where linters and automatic static analysis tools such as E_slint_ or S_onar just can't._

### What make debt-collector unique ?

* it works with **any files or language**
* it **tracks your progress** in time&#x20;
* it gives you tools to **predict the cost of change**
* you define **rules that are project / team specific**  (where other tools are based on generic rules)
* it helps **identify parts of your code that require more attention** than others
