# The Walk command

```
debt-collector walk
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The walk command require a specific configuration in order to work. See configuring for more informations
{% endhint %}

The walk command works like compare, but instead of comparing 2 revisions, it will walk throught commits in time and analyse changes in order to see the évolution of debt through time. It will generate an HTML file report under&#x20;

```
node_modules/.cache/debt-collector/report.html
```

This command is designed to be run on your base branch, either triggered by a cron or when releasing new software version.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order for the walk command to work, and depending on your configuration, make sure you have all git history on the target branch.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**DO NOT ABORT EXECUTION :** \
****As Debt Collector will checkout multiple times during the execution of this command, you may find yourself in a different git state if you do not let Debt collector run the commnd until completion.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
